This repository contains sources and compiled versions for several
packages that are part of TeX Live, but have no documentation in PDF
or HTML format.  The goal is that eventually every TeX Live package
should have documentation in at least one of these popular format.

I never write any text myself—I merely convert any documentation I can
find (README files, source code comments, etc.) into TeX form, or even
just compile DTX or TeX files written by the package author.  That
means that the copyright remains at the original authors—thus none of
the files generated by me carries a copyright notice.
