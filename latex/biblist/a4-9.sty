%%% \title{
%%%    A non-arbitrary A4 page layout\\
%%%    The {\tt a4-9\/} style option
%%%    }
%%% \author{\sc Joachim Schrod}

%%% \maketitle



%%% \sect This macro file is the |a4-9| document style option for \LaTeX{}
%%% that produces a {\it well designed\/} A4 page layout.  This style
%%% option works with all standard \LaTeX{} styles and should work with
%%% all other well written ones, too.  It should not be used with an
%%% underlined headings page style (see below for an explanation).

%%% But what does this mean: ``a {\it well designed\/} page layout''?
%%% Mostly it means that the design is not chosen by accident but
%%% within a {\it non-arbitrary process}. To my knowledge this theme
%%% has first been covered by Jan Tschichold in his famous article of
%%% 1962: ``Willk\"urfreie Ma\ss{}verh\"altnisse der Buchseite und
%%% des Satzspiegels'' (look for references at the end).  This style
%%% option implements his design (I'm no designer\,\dots)

%%% If you are interested in typography and you do not know anything of
%%% Jan Tschichold, you should---he and Stanley Morrison were probably the
%%% two most important typographers in this century.  He received as one
%%% of very few Europeans the gold medal of the American Institute of
%%% Graphic Arts, was a honorary member of the Double Crown Club, London,
%%% and of the Soci\'et\'e typographique de France.  Furthermore he was
%%% appointed as Honorary Royal Designer for Industry by the Royal Society
%%% of Arts, London.  In 1965 he got the Gutenberg-Preis of the city
%%% Leipzig (which celebrated its 800th~birthday in this year), the most
%%% important typographic award in Europe.

%%% \sect This style option implements the partition by nine of the A4
%%% page as explained by Tschichold.  The proportion for a two-sided
%%% layout is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:layout} (the picture is not true to
%%% scale due to the limited features of the \LaTeX{}-{\tt
%%% picture\/}-environment).

%%% \end{center}
%%% \caption{Partition by nine of the A4 page according to Tschichold}
%%% \label{fig:layout}
%%% \end{figure}
%%% %
%%% The important fact is that the proportions of the type area and the
%%% margins repeat the proportion of the whole page.  The above
%%% construction yields margins with a ratio of $ \sqrt{2} : 1 : 2 :
%%% 2\sqrt{2} $, where 1 is the ninth of the page width, i.e.\ $\rm
%%% 23\fract 1/3. \,mm$. But we do not use this exact value because
%%% the margin will be shortened by bookbinding or filing. We assume a
%%% total need of 8\,mm for such purposes which results in 4\,mm for
%%% each page. This 4\,mm will first be subtracted from the total
%%% margin width of 70\,mm and the remaining 66\,mm will be divided
%%% into one third for the inner margin and two third for the outer
%%% margin. The resulting approximate values are therefore: 
%%% %
%%% \begin{center}
%%% \begin{tabular}{lr}
%%% \multicolumn1{c}{\sc Dimension}& \multicolumn1{c}{\sc Value}\\[2pt]
%%% page width& 210\,mm\\
%%% width of type area& 140\,mm\\
%%% inner margin& 26\,mm\\
%%% outer margin& 44\,mm\\[1pt]
%%% page height& 297\,mm\\
%%% height of type area& 198\,mm\\
%%% top margin& 33\,mm\\
%%% bottom margin& 66\,mm\\
%%% \end{tabular}
%%% \end{center}
%%% %
%%% The value for the inner margin consists of 4\,mm for binding and
%%% filing purposes and 22\,mm ``real'' margin. Of course, all values
%%% are measured from the paper edge. 

%%% If the page layout is not for two-sided printing, it can be still
%%% assumed that a margin of c\`a.~4\,mm will be needed for filing.
%%% This remaining margin space of 66\,mm is distributed evenly on the
%%% left and on the right side. Precisely spoken, we use 37\,mm for
%%% the left margin ($\rm = 33\,mm + 4\,mm$) and 33\,mm for the right
%%% margin. The resulting margins have a ratio of $1 : 1 : 1 :
%%% 2\sqrt{2}$. 


%%% \sect The height of the type area needs a special remark: Usually this
%%% height does neither include the headline nor the footline. But if the
%%% headline is underlined the headline should be taken into
%%% account---that's the reason why this style option cannot be used with
%%% underlined headings.

%%% The values in the above table are only approximations to the one
%%% we will use in reality. An approximation because the height of the
%%% type area must be a multiple of a line height, i.e.\ it must equal
%%% $ (n-1)|\baselineskip| + |\topskip| $ where $n$ is the number of lines
%%% on one page. If we have to choose we will prefer the longer type area.


%%% \sect We assume a starting position of $\rm (2\,cm, 2\,cm)$, i.e., the
%%% \DVI{} driver shall leave a top and a left margin of 2\,cm by his own. This is
%%% different from the usual 1\,in margin---but the usual margin was made
%%% for legal paper ($\rm 8\,in \times 11.5\,in$). I hope that this 
%%% driver margin value---which was presented by Klaus Guntermann and 
%%% me at the Euro\TeX88 conference in Exeter---will be accepted
%%% by the \DVI{} driver standards commitee of TUG.

%%% |\hoffset| and |\voffset| are set to 0\,mm, so that we can proceed on
%%% the assumption of the above margin. If you use a driver which leaves a
%%% margin of 1\,in you should use the changefile |a4-marg.chf|.

%%% \beginprog
\hoffset=2cm  \advance\hoffset by -1in
\voffset=2cm  \advance\voffset by -1in
%%% \endprog


%%% \sect To get the precise value of |\textheight| we first calculate the
%%% number of lines which may be on the page in full. Then we add another
%%% line and recalculate the value of |\textheight|.

%%% \beginprog
\normalsize			 % this sets \baselineskip

\dimen@=198mm
\count@=\dimen@ 		 % value in sp
\advance \count@ by -\topskip	 % \topskip and \baselineskip will be
\divide \count@ by \baselineskip %	coerced to integer, value is in sp

\textheight=\count@\baselineskip % \count@ equals the number of lines - 1
\advance \textheight by \topskip
%%% \endprog


%%% \sect Because we have altered the original value of |\textheight|
%%% (198\,mm) we must alter the value of the top margin, too.  It will be
%%% just a third of the remaining place on the page.  Please note that the
%%% place for the top margin consists of the four values driver
%%% margin, |\topmargin|, |\headheight|, and |\headsep|. 

%%% \beginprog
\topmargin=297mm
   \advance \topmargin by -\textheight % place for top and bottom margin
   \divide \topmargin by 3	       % place for top margin
   \advance \topmargin by -20mm	       % driver margin
   \advance \topmargin by -\headheight
   \advance \topmargin by -\headsep

\textwidth=140.1mm
\if@twoside
   \oddsidemargin=6mm		       % 26mm - 20mm (driver margin)
   \evensidemargin=24mm		       % 44mm - 20mm (driver margin)
   \marginparwidth=33mm		       % half of total vertical margin
\else
   \oddsidemargin=17mm		       % 37mm - 20mm (driver margin)
   \marginparwidth=22mm		       % third of total vertical margin
   \evensidemargin=\maxdimen	% usage should result in an error message
\fi
%%% \endprog


%%% \sect We finish the macro file so that garbage (e.g.\ of exchanges
%%% between systems) can come afterwards.
