\maketitle

\noindent
This package provides the macros
%
\begin{flushleft}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
    \cmd{\ZifferAn}  & (equivalent with \verb+\ZifferPunktAn \ZifferStrichAn +) \\
    \cmd{\ZifferAus} & (equivalent with \verb+\ZifferPunktAus\ZifferStrichAus+) \\
    \cmd{\ZifferPunktAn}                                                        \\
    \cmd{\ZifferPunktAus}                                                       \\
    \cmd{\ZifferStrichAn}                                                       \\
    \cmd{\ZifferStrichAus}
  \end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
%
If \cmd{\ZifferAn} was used, then in numbers in math-mode the following happens:
%
\begin{flushleft}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}rl@{}}
    `\texttt{.}'  & is used as a `one-thousand separator' as common in Germany \\
    `\texttt{,}'  & is used as a decimal separator as common in Germany        \\
    `\texttt{-{}-}' & generates a \ZifferStrich\ with better spacing (e.\,g.\ in 1.000,\ZifferStrich)
  \end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
%
You may still use the symbols `\texttt{.}' `\texttt{,}' and `\texttt{-}' in other context in math mode.

The first two conversions are switched on by default, the last conversion has
to be switched on explicitly (this has been changed in v2.1):
You may switch on/off the conversions with
%
\begin{flushleft}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
    \cmd{\ZifferPunktAn}/\cmd{\ZifferPunktAus}   & (for the first two conversions) respectively \\
    \cmd{\ZifferStrichAn}/\cmd{\ZifferStrichAus} & (for the last conversion).
  \end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}

The reason why the last conversion is not on by default (and why it might be
necessary to [temporarily] switch off a conversion) is that certain packages
(in particular, newer versions of \pkg{amsmath}) cause problems with it.

There were some discussions which should be the correct output of the
above conversions (in particular, of `\texttt{-{}-}').
If you do not like my choice: You may customize (i.\,e.\ redefine) the macros
\cmd{\ZifferLeer} and \cmd{\ZifferStrich}
after loading the package to produce the `one-thousand separator'
respectively the `\ZifferStrich'.

All above command-names are in German, because I had expected that this
package is only needed for German texts. Meanwhile, I learned that also
other countries use this strange convention for numbers. However, for
downward compatibility, I decided to keep the name conventions anyway
(after all, the name of the package is in German anyway).
