Incorporated are basic ideas of Alan Hoenig (Thanks Alan!)
Thanks to Phil Taylor, who gave some useful hints during his
tutorial at the EURO~\TeX~92 in Prague.

Also thanks to Ulrik Vieth, who incorporated the macros for
generating captions within the windows.


\minisec{Known problems:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Don't use \cmd{\samepage}

\item
  Use \cmd{\footnotemark} within and \cmd{\footnotetext} outside the
  \env{window}-environment instead of \cmd{\footnote}

\item
  When using the \pkg{epic}-package load \pkg{picinpar} before \pkg{epic}
  like
\begin{verbatim}
\documentstyle[...,picinpar,epic]{...}
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}


\minisec{Changes:}

\begin{labeling}{1.2a}
\item[1.1]
  If \verb+\brokenpenalty\maxdimen+ then it's set to 9999 within the
  window's group

  Reported by kuhlmav@elec.canterbury.ac.nz

\item[1.2]
  When centering a window and the right column contains less
  lines than the left column then the right lines are raised
  by using \cmd{\vfill}

  Reported by Wolfgang Riedel, TU Chemnitz

\item[1.2a]
  A better way to shift the right box. There was some trouble
  when the window is on the left. I don't know why I didn't
  notice \TeX's overfull \cmd{\vbox}

  Reported by Stephan Seidl, \mail{seidl@rcs.urz.tu-dresden.de}
\end{labeling}
