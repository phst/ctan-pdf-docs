\noindent
This package is provided under the provisions of the \LaTeX\ Project
Public Licence, \url{http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt}

This packages provides font shapes to support bold small caps and TT
text.  There is a choice of bold TT fonts, which are selected by
package options \texttt{cmbtt} and \texttt{cmttb} (this reflects the confusingly
similar font names).  The default (based on the author's estimation
of the fonts' relative merits) is \texttt{cmttb}.

To use these fonts you need their \MF\ sources available to your
\TeX\ system (as far as I know, there are no Type~1 versions of the
fonts available yet).  Place them in an appropriate place under
\texttt{fonts/source} in your TDS \textsf{texmf} tree; place this file somewhere like
\texttt{tex/latex/misc} in your tree.  See
\url{http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=instpackages+wherefiles}
for more details.
