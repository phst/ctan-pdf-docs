\maketitle

The \LaTeX{} kernel produces the messages when something, while the~%
\verb|.aux| file is being scanned (after the \cs{AtEndDocument} tokens
have been executed), sets the \cs{if@tempswa} switch with the
command \cs{@tempswatrue}.

(This fact can be used by packages, such as my \pkg{footmisc.sty}, to
piggy-back on the message; but it's nice in that circumstance and
others to be sure where the message is coming from.)

This is a jiffy patch to the kernel so that it produces a
(\cs{typeout}) message for each label \emph{it} thinks has changed.

\begin{labeling}{Usage:}
\item[Usage:]
  Incorporate this code into a package or class file, \hfill or \\
  \cmd{\input} this file from a package or class file, \hfill or \\
  \verb|\makeatletter \input{checklab} \makeatother| in your document preamble
\end{labeling}

This software jiffy is placed in the public domain.  Do with it as
you wish, though I have to say I would prefer you not to claim it
as your own (\textsc{otoh}, it's the product of a twisted mind, so probably
not an attractive thing to claim).
