\maketitle

The \pkg{svgcolor} package defines the W3C Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
color names for use with both the \pkg{color} and \pkg{pstricks} packages.  These
packages must be loaded before \pkg{svgcolor} if the color names are to be
successfully defined.

Further information on the SVG colors is available online at

   \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#ColorKeywords}

The SVG colors are
